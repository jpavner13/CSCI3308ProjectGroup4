Ideas:
    1. Rip off Reddit
    2. Rip off FarmersOnly.com
    3. Meet the locals


Application Name: LocalZonely.com

Application Description: 
    We want to create a website that connects users (travelers) with locals of a given city. From there, they can chat/meet to talk about
the area and things that a local reccomends to do while traveling to their city.

Vision Statement:
    A website for travelers that connects them with locals to make the most of their trip.

Communication Plan: Discord

Meeting time: Tuesdays @ 10AM
