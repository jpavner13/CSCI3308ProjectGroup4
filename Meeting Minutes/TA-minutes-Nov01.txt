Talked through the meeting deliverables for future TA meetings
Brief overview of the weekly schedule breakdown
Talking about what our project is
First looking at wireframes
Nikita thinks the wireframes look good and are totally doable
Showed project board but haven’t added anything to it yet
This week’s lab is about test cases - start thinking about what cases we need for our project
Make sure the whole team is on the same page before lab
We should convert each wireframe page into an epic, then add subitems that need to be done for each
Look for an external API that could import reviews (trivago, TripAdvisor, etc…)
Use case diagram looks good
Make sure we upload all the files to GitHub
Take meeting minutes even for meetings without the TA

Action items from today:
1. Populate the project board
2. Look for external APIs
3. Everybody review the wireframes and agree on them

Mentioned that we haven’t contacted Caleb yet - Nikita is going to try and get a hold of him
